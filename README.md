## Theming with styled-components (This might be useful for random theme changes, but not for global styles as I should use [CSS custom props](https://daily.dev/posts/theming-styled-components-with-css-custom-properties))

(https?:\/\/(?:www\.|(?!www))[a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9-]+[a-zA-Z0-9]\.[^\s]{2,}|www\.[a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9-]+[a-zA-Z0-9]\.[^\s]{2,}|https?:\/\/(?:www\.|(?!www))[a-zA-Z0-9]+\.[^\s]{2,}|www\.[a-zA-Z0-9]+\.[^\s]{2,})

## Todo

- Redirect /fr to / with the new version of "gatsby-plugin-intl"
- True data localization with the upcoming strapi feature : right now query both languages and interpolate locale variable names in the javascript part OR conditional queries based on locale.
- The location state should be updated in a hook and shared across the components that need it
